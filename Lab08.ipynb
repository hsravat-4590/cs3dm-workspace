    "# CS3440 - Lab 8\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Use your recently acquired knowledge of practical Data Mining for a small project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suggested Reading\n",

    "## Brief description\n",
    "In this lab you'll fit a **classification** model to predict whether an individual will develop diabetes, based on some characteristics of that person. For that, you'll use a subset of a famous dataset known as the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset (PIDD). This subset of data (file *diabetes.csv* available on BB) consists of a number of observations related to women of Pima Indian heritage, aged 21 and above. Your task is to build a model capable of predicting the onset of diabetes (variable `Outcome`) based on the other variables in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diabetes dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Number of times pregnant\n",
    "2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test\n",
    "3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)\n",
    "4. Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)\n",
    "5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)\n",
    "6. Body mass index [(weight in kg)/(height in m)<sup>2</sup>]\n",
    "7. Diabetes pedigree function\n",
    "8. Age (in years)\n",
    "9. Outcome (Class variable - 0 or 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**TO DO**\n",
    "- Load the diabetes dataset\n",
    "- Explore the dataset using summary statistics: how many rows, how many columns, scale (range of values) in each column, presence or not of missing values, class balance (number of observations from each class)\n",
    "- Use function `pairplot()` from library Seaborn to generate a correlation plot. Set option `hue = 'Outcome'` to colour the plot by the outcome variable. Check this plot to make sure there isn't anything unusual in the data.\n",
    "    - Note: Some variables may not have missing data, but values that are impossible. Check the plot for that! For instance, is it possible for a person to have a body mass index (BMI) of zero? Or a blood pressure of zero? Use your common sense and apply listwise deletion (removal of rows) where these impossible values happen.\n",
    "- Split the data into a training (75%) and a test split (25%), _keeping the class balance within each split_. The easiest way to do that is using function `train_test_split()`, imported from *sklearn.model_selection*, and using option `stratify = your_target_variable` (replace `your_target_variable` by the name of your target variable).\n",
    "- Fit a **Random Forest** classifier (remember, you did this in Lab 5).\n",
    "- Use your test split to assess the performance of your classifier. Use the *f1_score* (imported from _sklearn.metrics_) to evaluate model quality."
